/**
 * An interface to immutable 2-D points and vectors. We use a single interface
 * for continuous (real-value) and discrete (integer-valued) points, which
 * allows us to write generic code over points of both varieties.
 * <p>
 * Type parameter {@code <T>} specifies whether the concrete implementation
 * of this interface uses {@code double}s or {@code int}s to represent the
 * coordinates. In particular:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implementations of {@code Point<Double>} must store the coordinates
 * as {@code double}s, such that methods {@link #x()} and {@link #y()} need not
 * perform conversions.</li>
 *   <li>Implementations of {@code Point<Integer>} must store the coordinates as
 * {@code int}s, such that methods {@link #intX()} and {@link #intY()} need not
 * perform conversions.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An additional requirement of this interface is that {@code Point<Integer>}s
 * are never equal to {@code Point<Double>}s. However, two {@code
 * Point<Integer>}s with the same coordinates must be considered equal even if
 * they are represented by different classes, and likewise for {@code
 * Point<Double>}s. Furthermore, because {@link Object#hashCode()} is required
 * to return the same value for objects that are considered equal, this means
 * that all implementations of {@code Point<Integer>} must agree on their {@code
 * hashCode()} methods (and likewise all {@code Point<Double>}s must agree with
 * one another). In order to help with this, this interface provides default
 * implementations for methods {@link #hashCodeForIntegerPoint()} and {@link
 * #hashCodeForDoublePoint()}. Implementations of the {@code Point} interface
 * should override {@code hashCode()} to return the value of one of these two.
